# No FB

Block facebook.com without ruining the rest of the web.

**The Problem**

If you block facebook.com, it can make other websites look terrible. Layouts
break, error messages are displayed. You get rid of Facebook, but the result is
not ideal.

**The Solution**

No FB replaces broken Facebook widgets with images of cats or other desirable
things. Much better!

## Setup

Add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file.

> 6.6.6.6    www.facebook.com
